# Launchpad Whack-A-Mole

A "Whack-A-Mole" style game that's played on a Novation Launchpad. This project demonstrates hardware integration by utilizing the Launchpad's grid for interactive gameplay.

## üéÆ Gameplay Overview

- **Objective**: Hit the "moles" as they appear on the Launchpad grid.

- **Controls**:
  - **Difficulty Selection**:
    - Button 1 (Green): Easy (Slowest speed, 32 possible points)
    - Button 2 (Yellow): Medium (Medium speed, 48 possible points)
    - Button 3 (Red): Hard (Fastest speed, 64 possible points)
  - **Start Game**:
    - Button 8 (Green): Begins the game with the selected difficulty.
    - *Note*: If no difficulty is selected, the game defaults to Easy mode.

- **Gameplay**
     - Lights on the Launchpad will light up, representing the "moles".
     - Players will press the buttons as they light up.  Each button successfully pressed before it goes out represents a successful "whack" and scores the player a point.

- **Scoring**
     - At the end of the game, the Launchpad will illuminate with one green light for each successfully "whacked" mole. Maximum scores are:
          -   Easy: 32 points
          -   Medium: 48 points
          -   Hard: 64 points
